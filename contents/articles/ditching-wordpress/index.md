Today I am launching the second version of my personal website.

I've migrated from WordPress to a static site, and spent a lot of time on UX and design.

I this post I'm going to write about the tools I use, static site generators, the migration itself, and open sourcing my website.<span class="more" />

# I haven't actually written this yet!

I'm putting the finishing touches on this site and then I will update this post.
