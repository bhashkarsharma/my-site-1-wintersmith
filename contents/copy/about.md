### Hello there!

I love the web and open-source; and want to create useful things that make people's lives easier.

I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at [MobStac](http://mobstac.com).

I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on [Quora](http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma), among other places.

The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.
