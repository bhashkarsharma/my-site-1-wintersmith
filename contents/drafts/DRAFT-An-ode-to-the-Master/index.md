_[The post below is on how I choose to see Steve. This might not fit your view of things, but that is okay. Remember: There's a layer of perception that we all have on top of [reality](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/quotes?qt=qt0324243).]_

A child about to be born to college students is put to be adopted at birth. The people who have signed up to adopt decide against it at the last minute, and he ends up with two non-graduate laypeople. He goes to college, but drops out in 6 months. Had this story not been told a hundred times, it would have been hard to believe that this child on growing up would quite literally change the World, and in a grand style at that.

This morning I woke up to the sad news that Steve Jobs has left us. To most others I know, he was the CEO of Apple, a visionary, an artist etc. To me, he was my iDol.

And he implored others to do the same.

I know people who have framed the text of this speech on his wall.

He was someone who aim was to make a 'Dent in the Universe' and he most definitely achieved it.
Jobs was a man for whom 'Think Different' was the way of life.
Referring to him as the CEO would be undermining what he was. He was a larger-than-life figure, a living icon, a man who actually used to 'Think Different'.

How many CEOs you know of, for whom people turn up to [offer flowers](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/news/hardware/Steve-Jobs-death-Flowers-letters-and-gadgets-at-Apple-store-shrines/articleshow/10260919.cms) at their product outlets?

The news of the death of Steve Jobs began filtering through the very devices he created.

Companies and people that make a living based on the ecosystem that he created.

The ideas and innovations that

And I believe it depicts truly what Apple stands for. Since Steve Jobs' return to the company and the miraculous turn-around (also referred to as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iCon-Steve-Jobs-Greatest-Business/dp/0471720836">the greatest second act in the history of business</a>) it went on to become the most valuable company in the US.

Its not about the rags-to-riches story
Its not about the products/companies he built
Its about the WHY.. His WHY was as different as it could've been compared to normal mortals.

Watch Pirates of Silicon valley
One last thing
Reality distortion field

Its about him being the embodiment of Think Different

Vision.. 25 years

What Steve meant to me

Selfish  7 yrs pain

Only Steve can understand Steve (It takes one to know one)

The man who reinvented industries - over and over again

One more thing

Us lesser humans can only understand a part of him. What he was is unexplainable in words.

I love his quote "Why join the Navy when you can be a pirate?"
